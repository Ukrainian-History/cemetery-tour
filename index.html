gravestones and monuments. This tour highlights only a tiny handful of them. We encourage you to explore the other
parts of the cemetery on your own at your leisure.</p>

<p>The tour begins with the first row of gravestones directly in front of the parking lot. Almost everybody buried in these first few rows is famous or notable in some respect. Here we highlight only a few.</p>

                    <p>If you wish, you can now proceed to the Holy Resurrection Mausoleum in the lower level of
St. Andew Memorial Church.</p>
<p>There you can view a short video about
the cemetery and view the crypt of His Holiness Patriarch Mstyslav I and an
associated exhibition.
Patriarch Mstyslav was the prime driving force behind the purchase of this property
on the Somerset/South Bound Brook border, the creation of St. Andrew Cemetery,
and the construction of St. Andrew Memorial Church.</p>

                    <p>Proceed to the large black granite cross in the
first row immediately to the right of the main road.
This is the grave of Metropolitan John (Teodorovych), the
first Ukrainian bishop of the
Ukrainian Orthodox Church
of the USA. All of his fellow
bishops and clergy that he
left behind in Soviet Ukraine
in 1924 were killed by Stalin
regime.</p>
<p><img src="images/met-john-stone.jpg" alt="Metropolitan John gravestone"></p>
<p>From here, proceed to the
Fisher Family Graveyard, which is
the fenced-in area on your right.
More details about the Fisher Graveyard will be available there.</p>

<p>In the area near the Fisher Family Graveyard are the graves of a number of noted artists, poets, and musicians.</p>
<p>Immediately next to the back corner of the Fisher Family Graveyard fence is the grave of the composer Mykola Fomenko.</p>
<p><img src="images/fomenko.jpg" alt="Mykola Fomenko gravestone"></p>
<p>Two rows behind him is the noted &ldquo;New York School&rdquo; Ukrainian poet Ievhen Malaniuk. His monument is unusually low and features a cast of his death mask.</p>
<p><img src="images/malaniuk.jpg" alt="Ievhen Malaniuk gravestone"></p>
<p>Behind him is one of the more extravagant monuments in the entire cemetery. It marks
the grave of the Ukrainian American sculptor Mykola Mukhin, who arrived in the United States in 1949 as a post-War refugee and established a studio in Philadelphia. We are not sure if this massive sculpture of a Cossak is his own work, but we would not be surprised if it was.</p>
<p><img src="images/mukhin.jpg" alt="Mykola Mukhin gravestone"></p>
<p>As you make your way from Mukhin&rsquo;s grave back to the main paved road, the last monument you will encounter marks the grave of the architect and architecture professor Volodymyr Sichyns&rsquo;kyi.</p>

                    <p>Make your way down the main paved road away from St. Andrew Memorial Church towards the large cross.</p>
<p><img src="images/memorial-cross.jpg" alt="Memorial Cross"></p>
<p>This cross was dedicated in 1971 to the memory of all who fought for the independence of Ukraine throughout
the 20th century. In addition, there is a large black granite memorial in front of St. Andrew Memorial Church that you likely saw as you were driving in which is dedicated to all Ukrainian Americans who were members of the United States armed forces.</p>
<p>Throughout the cemetery, you will see gravestones with a cross and sword like these:</p>
<p><img src="images/veterans.jpg" alt="War of Independence veterans"></p>
<p>These denote the graves of veterans of the Ukrainian War of Independence (1918-1921).</p>
<p>Continuing down the main road, you will eventually find on your left a special section
dedicated to veterans of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.
This guerrilla unit fought
against both the Nazis and the Soviets in the World War II period.</p>

                    <p>Make your way along the chained-off area of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army area toward the grassy
path that runs parallel
to the main road, and proceed back towards St. Andrew Memorial Church.</p>
<p><img src="images/tour-end.jpg" alt="Conclusion"></p>
<p>Four rows before you get to the
paved crossroad you will find
the grave of Myroslav
Chapovsky, a professor of forestry and soil
science.</p>
<p><img src="images/czapowski.jpg" alt="Myroslav Chapovsky"></p>
<p>Appropriately, his monument is sculpted
to look like it was made from two crossed wooden logs.</p>
<p>From here, you can
proceed back towards the
parking lot, or go exploring on your own.
Don&rsquo;t worry about getting lost, as the spire of St. Andrew Memorial Church is visible from almost everywhere in the cemetery.</p>
